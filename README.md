# Chatbot using Python and Machine Learning
## About

# Abstract
This project focuses on the development of an intelligent chatbot using Python and machine learning. Leveraging the power of natural language processing (NLP) models, the chatbot engages in contextually relevant conversations, enhancing user interaction. The Python programming language, along with libraries such as NLTK and TensorFlow, forms the backbone of the implementation, providing flexibility and scalability. The chatbot's natural language understanding is continuously improved through machine learning on extensive datasets. Rigorous testing and user feedback contribute to refining the model, showcasing the potential of combining Python and machine learning for creating adaptive and user-friendly chatbots.

## Future Work
In future, I'm looking forward to improve model's accuracy or I am going to use API of google to make  a chatbot using Gemini.
